# Music-Recommendation-System

## In this project, we use the dataset from Asia's leading music streaming service to build a better music recommendation system.
We will try to determine which new song or which new artist a listener might like based on their previous choices.
The primary task is to predict the chances of a user listening to a song repetitively within a time frame.
In the dataset, the prediction is marked as 1 if the user has listened to the same song within a month.
The dataset consists of which song has been heard by which user and at what time.
Use classification machine learning algorithms to solve this classification problem and as a challenge, try using deep learning algorithms like neural network.
