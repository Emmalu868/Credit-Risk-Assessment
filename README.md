# Credit Risk Assessment

## Project Background
Credit default risk is the chance that companies/individuals cannot make the required payments on their debt obligations, which can lead to a possibility of loss for a lender. Earlier credit analysts would perform risk management by analyzing the borrower’s credentials and capabilities, but this was prone to errors. With the advent of Machine learning, ML algorithms can perform a credit risk assessment with better precision and much faster than any humans.

## Project Goal
To quickly assess credit risk associated with companies or individuals with a high degree of accuracy.

## Project Objectives
1. Obtain source data and create a usable dataset for testing and training an ML model using logistic regression model and XGBoost model and compare the results.
2. Use a logistic regression model to analyze new source data.
3. Create a simple user interface for the ML model in AWS.

## Data Sets
* Credit Risk Dataset | Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset]
* **[loan_data_2007_2014.csv](https://github.com/Emmalu868/Credit-Risk-Assessment/blob/main/Resources/credit_risk_dataset.csv)**

## Tech-stack
Predict creditworthiness using Logistic Regression and XGBoost machine learning models on Jupyter Notebook and evaluate the model’s performance. 
Build an user interface for the models in Amazon Web Services using Lambda function.
